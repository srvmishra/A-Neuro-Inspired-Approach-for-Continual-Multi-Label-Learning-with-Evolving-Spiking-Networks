# A-Neuro-Inspired-Approach-for-Continual-Multi-Label-Learning-with-Evolving-Spiking-Networks
Official Codebase for our work "A Neuro-Inspired Approach for Continual Multi-Label Learning with Evolving Spiking Networks" accepted for publication at Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 2026.

Place the datasets in a separate folder `datasets` just outside the main code directory. The `datasets` folder will contain individual dataset folders for each dataset. All datasets have been taken from [MULAN](https://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html).

For dimensionality reduction, we use the MVMD algorithm provided in [A multi-label feature extraction algorithm via maximizing feature variance and feature-label dependence simultaneously](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705116000526#!). You can contact their authors for the dimensionality reduction code. The processed datasets will be put in the `datasets` folder.
